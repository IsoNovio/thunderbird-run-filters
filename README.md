# Context Menu Option to Run Filters
This add-on adds a context menu item when you right/context-click a folder or a message that allows you to run rules on them.

## Note on the migration to the ESM APIs
According to [this source](https://thunderbird.topicbox.com/groups/addons/T51f3be1c0e12e5fe), Thunderbird supports both JSMs and ESMs in versions 128-136.
Later versions will only support ESMs.
Thus, this add-on has migrated to ESMs.
Currently, similar add-ons like [Filter on Folder Button](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/filter-on-folder-button/) and [New Folder Filters Button](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/new-folder-filters-button/) have not migrated, so they may not work in the latest versions of Thunderbird.

## Credits
- Other add-ons like [Filter on Folder Button](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/filter-on-folder-button/) and [New Folder Filters Button](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/new-folder-filters-button/) do similar work. The difference is that this add-on adds the options to the context menu.
